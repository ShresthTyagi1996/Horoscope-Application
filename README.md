# Horoscope-Application

My first application using JavaScript, I have created two functions, the first function will get the value of input field and return the first character of the string. The Second function is storing the value from function 1 and changing the string in lowerCase alphabet and I have used switch function to generate the desired response and posting the result i.e. horoscope value from javascript to HTML using textContent.

Please feel free to use the application on your website. If something feels wrong, don't hesitate to reach out.
